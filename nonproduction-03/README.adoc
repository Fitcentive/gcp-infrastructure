= Nonproduction project

This is a precursor to the GKE DEV ENV

== Pre-reqs
. Create GCP project manually via GCP UI
. Create terraform remote state bucket manually in the GCP UI named `fitcentive-02-tf-state-nonproduction`
    - Region `northamerica-northeast2`
    - Enable versioning
. TF state import created bucket so terraform is aware
    - `tf init`
    - Comment out provider `google-beta` before importing tf state

----
    - `tf import google_storage_bucket.terraform-nonproduction-remote-state-bucket fitcentive-dev-02/fitcentive-02-tf-state-nonproduction`
. Uncomment out the provider once state is imported

== Applying changes
. `tf apply -target module.dev-terraform-service-account`
. `tf apply`
    - If there is a `403` while applying, it is probably a race condition. Simply reapply

== Post apply changes
. Update kubectl to import GKE cluster data
    - `gcloud container clusters get-credentials $(terraform output -raw gke_dev_kubernetes_cluster_name) --region northamerica-northeast2-a`
. Update `flutter_app` with Firebase push notification service account
