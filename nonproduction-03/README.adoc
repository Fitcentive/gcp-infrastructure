= Nonproduction project

This is a precursor to the GKE DEV ENV

== Pre-reqs
. Create GCP project manually via GCP UI
. Create terraform remote state bucket manually in the GCP UI named `fitcentive-02-tf-state-nonproduction`
    - Region `northamerica-northeast2`
    - Enable versioning
. TF state import created bucket so terraform is aware
    - `tf init`
    - Comment out provider `google-beta` before importing tf state
+
[source,hcl]
----
include::./terraform/provider.tf[lines=33..38]
----
    - `tf import google_storage_bucket.terraform-nonproduction-remote-state-bucket fitcentive-dev-02/fitcentive-02-tf-state-nonproduction`
. Uncomment out the provider once state is imported

== Applying changes
. `tf apply -target module.dev-terraform-service-account`
. `tf apply`
    - If there is a `403` while applying, it is probably a race condition. Simply reapply

== Post apply changes
. Update kubectl to import GKE cluster data
    - `gcloud container clusters get-credentials $(terraform output -raw gke_dev_kubernetes_cluster_name) --region northamerica-northeast2-a`
. Update `flutter_app` with Firebase push notification service account
    - https://console.firebase.google.com/u/4/project/fitcentive-dev-02/settings/general/android:io.fitcentive.flutter_app[Go to the firebase console and copy over the `google-services.json` file for the Android app] and copy it into the flutter_app as described
    - https://console.firebase.google.com/u/4/project/fitcentive-dev-02/settings/general/ios:io.fitcentive.flutterApp[Go to the firebase console and copy over the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for the iOS app] and copy it into the flutter_app as described

== Migrate between GCP environments
. Backup existing CloudSQL instance
- Navigate to CloudSQL via GCP console
- Select `export`
. Backup existing buckets in GCS
- Terraform state buckets
- `fitcentive-dev-03-image-service-upload-images`
- `fitcentive-dev-03-cloud-sql-pgdump`
. Create new GCP project in the GCP console
. Use gcloud to create new credentials via terminal.
- `gcloud auth login` - with the new GCP account
- `gcloud config configurations create fitcentive-dev-03`
- `gcloud config set account <emailId>@gmail.com`
- `gcloud config set project fitcentive-dev-03`
- `gcloud config configurations activate fitcentive-dev-03`
- `gcloud config set compute/zone northamerica-northeast2-a`
- `gcloud config list`
- `gcloud auth application-default login` - with the new GCP account
. Update project code to replace project name
- For example, replace `fitcentive-dev-02` with `fitcentive-dev-03`
. Follow README instructions for `Nonproduction` and `gke-dev-env` projects
. Import GCS buckets that were exported previously
- Import can be done by uploading folder/files from UI
- NOTE - Owing to differences in file-system between GCS and UNIX, folders might not show up on the mount despite existing in GCS
- Quick fix is to use `mkdir` to create all existing GCS "directories" so the mount is aware of files within them
- Elegant fix would be to further investigate the option `gcsfuse` provides `--implicit-dirs` - but this does not seem to work as expected

. Update client secrets for Keycloak Identity Providers
- Fetch Facebook app secret from Facebook developer UI
- Fetch Google client secret from GCP APIs and Credentials UI
- Fetch Apple client secret from downloaded file
. Migrate keycloak data
- Detailed instructions given below
. **Hack** - Copy over TLS cert manually via already applied YAML into different namespaces
- This is done to avoid creating certificate issue requests against LetsEncrypt
- LetsEncrypt has a very limited amount of certs per week
- Once a TLS cert is created via ingress annotations, copy over the manifest definition and modify the `namespace` and other appropriate fields
- Apply the modified definition via `kubectl` to ensure that a fresh certificate is not issued
. Deploy all service manifests via `kubectl`
- Knock off services by namespaces list
. Update Keycloak `webapp` client config
- The `webapp` clients for various identity providers need some additional config
- To the `Web origins` config, add the app host url `https://app.fitcentive.xyz`
To the `Redirect URLs` config, add the app host url `https://app.fitcentive.xyz/auth.html`
- Ensure this is done for **all** identity providers (Native/Google/Facebook/Apple)


=== Instructions for migration of Keycloak data
. Connect to the old `keycloak-helm-db` schema via IntelliJ
. Export as SQL scripts - include create table expressions
. Global replace `create table` with `create table if not exists`
. Global replace `create index` with `create index if not exists`
. Via IntelliJ, execute SQL scripts against the `public` schema in `keycloak-helm-db`
- Execute these scripts 3-4 times, until all data is inserted
- Make sure it is executed on top of existing created definitions
- It is required to do it multiple times because some tables/expressions depend on others
. If done correctly, Keycloak auth server will not ask you to reconfigure an admin password, and same values from previous keycloak server can be reused (includes clientId/publicKeys for realms as well)
. **NOTE: Identity Providers for OIDC logins need to be reconfigured - ** For example, it might be required to update the client secret for the Google Identity Provider in the `GoogleAuth` realm.
- Find this value in the OIDC client provider settings portal.
- This is needed as secret values aren't automatically migrated over as part of above operations

- Re apply client secret for Facebook/Apple providers as well as Google provider
